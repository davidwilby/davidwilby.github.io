### About Me
As a Research Software Engineer, my interest is in facilitating the best possible practice in research computing, 
from good training to advocating reproducible scientific software methods. Currently, most of my work involves 
providing support regarding impactful research software in the Department of Computer Science at the University of 
Sheffield - mostly in the Natural Language Processing research group.

### Background
My background is in animal vision research using methods from computing and physical sciences. Primarily, my 
research has been in using numerical computational methods to explore the optics of three-dimensional visual 
anatomy. During my PhD  at the University of Bristol I developed FDTD simulations for studying the optics 
of avian retinal photoreceptors. Following this I worked on ray tracing analyses of 3D ocelli and compound eye 
volumes of bumblebees and hoverflies with Stockholm and Lund University.
However, I've had an eclectic career including (but not limited to): startling hermit crabs in behavioural 
experiments; training chickens to study their colour vision; diving for mantis shrimp to study their secret 
polarized signals; and doing R&D on TeraHertz electronics for space science.
